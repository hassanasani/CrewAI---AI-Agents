This was my first attempt at creating AI Agents. 

This particular group of AI Agents create a custom trip itinerary based on the users preferences, location, and dates. The planner will then find the perfect itinerary for the user. 

This setup of AI Agent costs $0, running completely on the users device using the powerful LLama3.1

If the user decides to change the version, it takes simple tweaking of the code and this powerful tool can easily become even more powerful through future improvements. 

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please reach out to me personally at hassanasani2004@gmail.com

Special thank you to codewithbrandon and Jo√£o for their guidance and lessons on such a powerful and useful tool.
